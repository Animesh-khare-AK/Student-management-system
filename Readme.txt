1.Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Eclipse-:
Eclipse served as my primary IDE for developing the project. Its robust features, including code navigation, debugging, and plugin support, greatly facilitated the development process.
2.Web Server: Apache Tomcat 9-:
I deployed the project on Apache Tomcat 9, a reliable and widely used servlet container. Tomcat efficiently handled HTTP requests and served our Java Servlets.
3.Backend Technology: Java Servlets-:
Java Servlets formed the backbone of our application. They allowed us to handle dynamic content, manage sessions, and interact with the database.
4.Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-:
For the user interface, I employed a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provided the structure, CSS handled styling, and JavaScript added interactivity.
